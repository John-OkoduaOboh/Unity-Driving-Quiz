## General info
### Implementation of simulation

This is a 3d driving game made to teach users driving rules. It was designed to be a more interactive way to learn driving rules.

The game allows users to drive around the area, directing them on where to go and spawning up quiz questions when they reach a certain spot on the map.

Once the user is done with the quiz, they are then shown their score and can retake the quiz if they want.

### Running the Program
When ran, the user is spawned on the driving environment with immediate directons on where to move, as they follow the instructions, they are given questions to then answer.
Once they answer the question, they then continue to move and answer questions until they have answered all of them.
## Setup
To run this project, select the .exe file and the project will run and load up the game, with the menu being the first thing shown to the user.
